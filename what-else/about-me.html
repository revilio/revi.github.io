      <p class="pres">
        I'm revi, i'm born in 2007, in france. I should be dead some hours or
        days after i was born but here i am.
      </p>
      <p class="pres">
        My life is a bit tricky but i've learnt to live with it, and i try to
        make the best of it.
      </p>
      <p class="pres">
        I'm currently studying in further studies to became an automatician or
        robotician, & why not both!
      </p>
      <p class="pres">
        BUT i don't learn that much at school, so i try to learn things by
        myself at home, like coding, and bunch of other stuff.
      </p>
      <p class="pres">
        i've learned a lot by myself in my life since years ago and even if that
        was hard sometimes, i think it also make me the person i am today and
        i'm proud of it.
      </p>
      <p class="pres">
        if i can give one advice it'll be to never stop learning and always stay
        curious.
      </p>
      <p class="pres">
        but also never forget to be yourself, people will make you suffer
        sometimes for that but once you get through it, you'll be stronger,
        prouder and happier.
